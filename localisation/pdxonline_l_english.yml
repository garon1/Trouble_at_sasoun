### State Descriptions ###

ARM_Population_Adana:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Arab (Syrian), Armenian\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Alawite, Orthodox Christian"
ARM_Population_Adana_desc:0 "Once part of the Cilician Armenia, the Autonomous Region of Adana was created after the Egyptian forces under Muhammed Ali invaded the Armenian Empire and marched their armies all the way up the Lebanese coast. As one of the first industrialised regions of the empire, the Autonomous Region represents a significant portion of the Armenian industrial base, as its location in the centre of the Turkish and Arab regions, and its connection by railroad and ship prove it to be the perfect location. Unexploited mineral resources furthermore linger in its highlands awaiting further exploitation.\n\nOne cannot deny the severity with which the region was hit during the Weltkrieg as its prosperous Armenian population, responsible for much of the aforementioned industry, evaporated overnight as deportations and massacres culled the majority of them. As the war approached its end however, and the likelihood of an Entente victory decreased, some of the thousands that were forced to leave all their belongings behind were allowed to return to the region seeing their properties confiscated and their rights stripped. Those that are left remain bitter and with a desire for revenge but their almost negligible population counts have eroded their capacity to organise any significant opposition to their Muslim administrators."

ARM_Population_Samson:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek (Pontic)\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
ARM_Population_Samson_desc:0 "Home to the Pontic Greeks, the Trabzon Autonomous Region was once one of the most powerful economic regions of the Empire, deriving its wealth from the nascent industry in Samsun and Trabzon and the flourishing Greek merchant class which controlled both the fishing and trade on the Black Sea. Just as in the other Christian regions of the empire though, the deportations and massacres struck deep as the Pontic Greeks were targeted by the plans of Talaat Pasha. Contrary to the Armenian population however, the majority of the Greek population survived the massacres, and although refugees have been fleeing the region ever since the start of the Weltkrieg, the recent improvements in Greek-Armenian relations and the flourishing economy have ensured a slow recovery of the pre-war Greek population.\n\nTensions remain high between the Muslim majority and the Greek minority as the latter’s political status and wealth is met with jealousy from the poor Turkish inland sandjaks. This tension is also reflected in Konstantiniyye, as the Greeks flock to the banner of the OPAD in the hopes that their decentralisation program will protect them in the future. The Turkish majority however, has found solace in the rhetoric of Mustafa Kemal, who promises a stronger Turkish people and state directed programs to assist the impoverished Turks."

ARM_Population_Sivas:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Kurdish\nMajority Religion: §YAlevi§!, Sunni Muslim"
ARM_Population_Sivas_desc:0 "In poverty only second to Ankara, the Autonomous Region of Sivas is not a glamorous part of the Empire, and more often than not forgotten about in the capital. Its population, predominately Turkish peasants after the Armenian Massacres eradicated its middle class, is often used as one of the main manpower pools of the Empire as its population remains deeply loyal to the Armenian government.\n\nPolitically the population, much like the other rural areas of Anatolia, has spoken out in favour of Kemal whose prestige and status during the final days of the Weltkrieg remains burned into their minds. Not only his success on the field flocks the SiHakkari population to his flag, as his plans to tackle religion in the empire have given hope to the Alevi population that their constant struggle with the Sunnis might finally come to an end."

ARM_Population_Lazistan:0 "Majority Culture: §YLazi§!, Turkish, Georgian\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
ARM_Population_Lazistan_desc:0 "Inhabited by the Kartevlian Lazi minority, the Sandjak of Lazistan was a cosmopolitan society consisting of Greek, Turkish, Kurdish, Georgian, Armenian and Lazi people. Originally even claimed by the Armenian state, very little remains of its non-Muslim population as the massacres struck the area hard and thousands of Armenians were slaughtered during the Weltkrieg. Reprisals by Russo-Armenian troops before the 1917 revolution made matters even worse as the already exhausted population suffered another hit, now to its Sunni population. As the end of the Weltkrieg arrived for the Lazi people, their lands have been ravaged by war and constant migration. Their economy, based on agriculture (mainly the export of hazelnuts) and the exploitation of the Zinc mines, has not aged well either as many have permanently left the region in search of better lands.\n\nThe Lazi people share many similarities with the Georgian people further up North, and although the difference in religion between Christian Georgia and Muslim Lazistan have thusfar led to little cooperation between the two regions, Georgian spies have been caught in the region who have supposedly been attempting to gather support for an anti-Armenian insurrection. Their attempts seem to have failed however thusfar as the Lazis are fairly content with our rule and have little faith in Georgian rule."

ARM_Population_Kars:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Kurdish\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
ARM_Population_Kars_desc:0 "The Autonomous Region of Kars was seized by the Russian Empire after our defeat in the Russo-Armenian war and has only fairly recently returned to the Empire. Decades of rule by the Russians and their Armenian allies, Armenians became a sizeable minority in the Kars Oblast although never becoming more than a majority. The war has not been kind to this Armenian population however, as what once constituted 30% of the total population has now been reduced to the single digits, with those that remain afraid of further punitive actions by the Armenian government. The nearby Armenian Autonomous Region has attracted many of the survivors of such atrocities as no attempt was made by the Armenian Empire to stop them from leaving. What is left is a Muslim province inhabited by Turks and a Kurdish minority loyal to the Armenian regime that has saved them from Russian adHakkarices and the Armenian reprisals.\n\nIts economy is solely based on agriculture, with the majority of its lands devoted to the cultivation of grain and the remaining part used for animal husbandry. Around the pastures of Ardahan and Kars there is also a sizeable beekeeping culture although its effects on the overall economy remain fairly low."

ARM_Population_Diyarbakir:0 "Majority Culture: §YKurdish§!, Turkish, Arab (Syrian)\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
ARM_Population_Diyarbakir_desc:0 "Part of the Kurdish core territories, the region of Diyarbakir is a prosperous albeit, agrarian, region as its capital, the city of Diyarbakir, is known as an important centre of learning and important city for the Muslim faith. Home of the Diyarbakir Ulu Camii, the fifth holiest site in Islam and one of the oldest churches in the world, the city and its region suffered greatly during the last years of the Weltkrieg, as illness, fire and misery plagued its population.\n\nServing as an important strategic location for the Armenian armed forces on the Eastern flank of the Empire, it is closely supervised by the Empire in the hopes of avoiding another confrontation with the Kurdish people. Resistance to Konstantiniyye remains little for the moment, but fears of the far reaching secularisation promoted by the OHF and the centralised control rule within the Kurdish region, as they are afraid that without the uniting factor of the Caliphate, the Turks will slowly but surely push them out."

ARM_Population_Hakkari:0 "Ethnic & Religious Demographics: Minority Turkish, Significant Christian §YAssyrian§!, §YArmenian§! & Sunni §YKurdish§! "
ARM_Population_Hakkari_desc:0 "South East Anatolia, especially the city of Hakkari has always been a disputed place, especially for the Christian Assyrians and Muslim Kurds. Once the Partition of the Armenian Empire began, these minorities sprung up, hoping to take the whole region under either Kurdish or Assyrian control for when the new borders of the region would be established. Despite the fact that Armenians made up a minority in the region pre 1894, it was given as an autonomous province directly to Russia, whereas the city of Hakkari was given to the newly formed Kurdistan.\n\nAssyrians and Kurds were outraged, yet this didn't change anything. Apparently the Russians annexed the region to avoid any ethnic conflicts, by giving the land to the Armenians. Assyrians began to outnumber the Kurds as the years went on, but in Hakkari the outcome was the opposite, and gradually a mutual unrecognized population exchange between Muslims and Christians in the region began. Today, Kurds are still a significant minority alongside Assyrians, with Turks and Armenians making up a smaller minority (both making about 10% of the population each). Today, South East Anatolia is rural and mountainous and one of the poorest regions in all of Hayastan, especially due to the loss of Hakkari 40 years before."

ARM_Population_Erzurum:0 "Ethnic & Religious Demographics: Significant Christian §YArmenian§! & Sunni §YTurkish§!"
ARM_Population_Erzurum_desc:0 "During the 1894 rebellion, Karin was a hotbed for Armenian rebels, and for decades earlier a hotbed for Armenian nationalism. After the Treaty of Baku was signed and ratified, the region of Karin went through a significant change. The Armenian population from 1900-1920 boomed while Turks, feeling pressure from the Russians and Armenians alike moved out in masse. Depopulated Muslim Turkish towns repopulated with Christian Armenians. By 1920, 55% of people in Karin were Armenians.\n\nAfter Armenians gained independence, Turks, especially in the peripheral regions of Eastern Anatolia rebelled to unify with Turkey. Infrastructure was damaged, railroads were blown up, which only made the war effort in the Caucasus harder and harder. After peace came, the Turkish rebels gradually faided until 1933 when rebels were thoroughly pushed underground. The same year, in 1933 the Armenian leader Garegin Nzhdeh decided to move the capital to Karin in order to have more control over the Armenian provinces from Shusha to Sivas.\n\nKarin is an economically and culturally important region of Armenia, not only serving as the nation's capital, but also is one of the fastest growing provinces in the entire country. Karin also is in the midst of industrializing, receiving heavy funds from the government."
